    "### Task 1: Identifying Learning Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Objective: For each given task, determine which type of learning paradigm it belongs to (Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, etc.) and provide a brief explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Tasks:\n",
    "- 1. Classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "    - Type: Supervised Learning\n",
    "    - Reason: The dataset contains labeled examples (images of digits with corresponding labels), making it a classic classification problem.\n",
    "- 2. Grouping customer transactions into different spending categories without predefined labels.\n",
    "    - Type: Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "    - Reason: There are no predefined categories, so clustering techniques such as K-Means or DBSCAN are used.\n",
    "- 3. Training an autonomous agent to play chess by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.\n",
    "    - Type: Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "    - Reason: The agent learns by taking actions and receiving feedback (rewards/punishments) rather than from labeled data.\n",
    "- 4. Detecting spam emails based on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "    - Type: Supervised Learning\n",
    "    - Reason: The model is trained using labeled emails to classify future messages as spam or not.\n",
    "- 5. Generating human-like text using a language model without explicit supervision.\n",
    "    - Type: Self-Supervised Learning\n",
    "    - Reason: The model (e.g., GPT) learns patterns from vast text data without manually labeled inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Selecting Suitable Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Objective: For each given task or dataset, determine the most suitable neural network architecture and explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Tasks and Suitable Neural Networks:\n",
    "- 1.\tImage classification (e.g., recognizing cats and dogs in pictures).\n",
    "\t- Suitable Network: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\t- Reason: CNNs are designed to capture spatial hierarchies in images using convolutional layers, which improve feature extraction.\n",
    "- 2.\tPredicting future stock prices based on historical financial data.\n",
    "\t- Suitable Network: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) / Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\t- Reason: These networks handle sequential data and learn temporal dependencies, making them effective for time series forecasting.\n",
    "- 3.\tGenerating realistic human faces from random noise.\n",
    "\t- Suitable Network: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\n",
    "\t- Reason: GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to create high-quality synthetic images.\n",
    "- 4.\tProcessing and translating text from English to French.\n",
    "\t- Suitable Network: Transformer (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5)\n",
    "\t- Reason: Transformers handle long-range dependencies in text and excel in natural language processing tasks like machine translation.\n",
    "- 5.\tClassifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\t- Suitable Network: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "\t- Reason: MLPs work well for tabular data with structured features and can be used for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3: Setting Up a PyTorch Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ“Œ Objective: Set up a suitable deep learning environment on your laptop using Anaconda and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Install PyTorch with Anaconda (Recommended Approach):\n",
    "- 1. **Download and Install Anaconda (if not already installed)**:\n",
    "\t- Download from [Anacondaâ€™s official website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).\n",
    "\t- Install it following the on-screen instructions for your OS (Windows/Linux/macOS).\n",
    "   \n",
    "- 2. **Create a new virtual environment in Conda**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Open the Anaconda terminal and run:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "         conda create --name deep_learning python=3.9\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     This creates an isolated environment named deep_learning with Python 3.9 (or other Python versions $\\geq$ 3.9).\n",
    "\n",
    "     **Note:** On Windows or Mac systems, an easier way to create a new virtual environment is to open the **Anaconda.Navigator** software, go to the **Environments** section and click the **Create** button.\n",
    "     \n",
    "- 3. **Activate the environment**:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "         conda activate deep_learning\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "      **Note:** If you have already opened the **Anaconda.Navigator** software, go to the **Environments** section and select **your_env_name** environment, then click '''Open Terminal'''\n",
    "     \n",
    "- 4. **Install PyTorch**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     Run the following code in your terminal to install the CPU version PyTorch:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "         conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     **Note:** If you have a CUDA-compatible GPU, you can install the GPU version PyTorch with code:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "         conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \n",

    "      Run the following code in your terminal to install required Python packages:\n",
    "     ```sh\n",
    "     pip install matplotlib h5py scipy tqdm\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     \n",
    "- 6. **Verify installation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Run ``python`` in the terminal to enter the Python programming environment, and then run the following code:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "        import torch\n",
    "        print(torch.__version__)\n",
    "        print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should print True if using a GPU version\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     **Note:** Run ```exit()``` to exit the Python programming environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 7. **Install JupyterLab**:\n",
    "     \n",
    "  You can install **[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)** with ```conda``` command in your terminal:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    or with ```pip``` command:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     pip install jupyterlab\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  After the JupyterLab has been successfully installed, run the following command in your terminal to start it:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  jupyter lab\n",
    "  ```\n",
