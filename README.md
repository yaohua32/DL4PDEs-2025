# Deep Learning for PDEs in Engineering Physics
The GitHub repository is for the course "Deep Learning for PDEs in Engineering Physics", which is taught in TUM jointly by Yaohua Zang, Koutsourelakis Faidon-Stelios, and Scholz Vincent in Summer 2025. It contains lecture materials, code examples, and practice problems related to deep learning methods for solving PDEs.

## Course Objectives
- Understand deep learning fundamentals and learn to build/train neural networks in PyTorch.
- Develop familiarity with deep learning approaches for solving PDEs.
- Gain hands-on experience implementing deep learning algorithms for PDEs.
- Apply these methods to real-world engineering physics problems.

## Content of the Course
The course consists of lectures, hands-on tutorials, and practical assignments. Below is a breakdown of topics covered:
- Deep Learning Basics: Introduction to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and implementing and training ANNs with PyTorch
- Classical PDE Methods: PDE fundamentals and classical numerical methods, such as finite difference (FDM) and finite element (FEM)
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): Introduction to PINNs and implementing PINNs for PDEs and analyzing limitations
- Deep Ritz Method (DeepRitz): Understanding the DeepRitz method and implementing DeepRitz for solving PDEs
- Deep Neural Operator Network (DeepONet): Introduction to parametric PDE problems and the deep neural operators; Implementing DeepONet for parametric PDE problems
- Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): Understanding FNO and implementing FNO for parametric PDE problems

## Repository Contents
- Lecture: Hands-on tutorials and code examples.
- Practice: Assignments for self-study and reinforcement.
