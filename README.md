# Deep Learning for PDEs in Engineering Physics
The GitHub repository is for the course "Deep Learning for PDEs in Engineering Physics", which is taught in TUM jointly by Yaohua Zang, Koutsourelakis Faidon-Stelios, and Scholz Vincent in Summer 2025. It contains lecture materials, code examples, and practice problems related to deep learning methods for solving PDEs.

#### Important Notes
- Dr. Vincent Scholz is responsible for the **lecture content** (presentations), while Dr. Yaohua Zang oversees the **practical sessions** (coding exercises).
- The course **lecture notes and slides** are available on Google Drive: [2025_05_Course_DL4PDE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VmuBPZFolwSnZTje5JwXa_b-hCSsQnOW?usp=sharing)
- **Reference solutions and sample code** for all exercises are available upon request or based on specific requirements.

## Course Objectives
- Understand deep learning fundamentals and learn to build/train neural networks in PyTorch.
- Develop familiarity with deep learning approaches for solving PDEs.
- Gain hands-on experience implementing deep learning algorithms for PDEs.
- Apply these methods to real-world engineering physics problems.

## Content of the Course
The course consists of lectures, hands-on tutorials, and practical assignments. Below is a breakdown of topics covered:
- **Deep Learning Basics**: Introduction to artificial neural networks (ANNs) and implementing and training ANNs with PyTorch
- **Classical PDE Methods**: PDE fundamentals and classical numerical methods, such as
  - finite difference (**FDM**)
  - finite element (**FEM**)
- **Physics-informed deep learning methods:** Popular physics-informed deep learning methods, such as
  - Physics-Informed Neural Networks (**PINNs**)
  - Deep Ritz Method (**DeepRitz**)
- **Data-driven Deep Neural Operators:** Popular deep neural operator methods based on supervised learning, such as
  - Deep Neural Operator Network (**DeepONet**)
  - Fourier Neural Operator (**FNO**)

The methods taught in this course will be illustrated on various PDEs in engineering physics: the heat equation, Darcy flow, linear elasticity equations, wave equations, Navier-Stokes equations, etc.
